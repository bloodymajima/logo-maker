// The application must include Triangle, Circle, and Square classes, as well as tests for each of these classes using Jest. While not a requirement, it is recommended that you place any common functionality and properties shared by the Triangle, Circle, and Square classes in a parent Shape class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.
// Each shape class should be tested for a render() method that returns a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.

// The following example test should pass:
// const shape = new Triangle();
// shape.setColor("blue");
// expect(shape.render()).toEqual('<polygon points="150, 18 244, 182 56, 182" fill="blue" />'); 

const inquirer = require('inquirer');
const {Circle, Square, Triangle} = require('apply./lib/shapes');


inquirer
  .prompt([
    /* Pass your questions in here */
  ])
  .then((answers) => {
    // Use user feedback for... whatever!!
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    if (error.isTtyError) {
      // Prompt couldn't be rendered in the current environment
    } else {
      // Something else went wrong
    }
